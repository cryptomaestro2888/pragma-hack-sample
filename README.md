# Pragma Hackathon Template 🧪

This repository serves as a template for building with Pragma

> After deploying a contract, you need to call the initializer function (which can be called only one time per value set).

## Getting Started 🚀

You can find all the addresses to interact with, in the pragma [documentation](https://docs.pragmaoracle.com/docs/starknet/Cairo%201/data-feeds/consuming-data).

## Supported Assets 📈

You can find the list of supported assets [here](https://docs.pragmaoracle.com/docs/starknet/Cairo%201/data-feeds/supported-assets) or on the [pragma homepage](https://pragmaoracle.com/).

## Cairo 0 & Cairo 1 💚

This template includes code for interacting both with pragma cairo 0 contracts and cairo 1 contracts.
You can find more information about the migration in our [documentation](https://docs.pragmaoracle.com/docs/starknet/migration).

You can find related docs/examples :

- [Cairo 1](https://docs.pragmaoracle.com/docs/starknet/Cairo%201/data-feeds/consuming-data)
- [Cairo 0](https://docs.pragmaoracle.com/docs/starknet/Cairo%200/data-feeds/consuming-data)

You can find the full cairo 1 repo [here](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-oracle).

⚠️ Cairo 0 Contracts will be deprecated in the coming months.
We recommend you to directly use the cairo 1 contracts.
